    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Unmodeled dynamics and data-driven balance control strategy are presented in this paper for a class of underactuated mechanical systems with two freedoms. The idea behind the method is as follows. First, the underactuated system is divided into two subsystems. Linear models for each subsystem are constructed from the experimental datum. The proportional derivative (PD) controller can be designed by this linear model. The unmodeled dynamic compensator is designed to deal with modeling error between the linear model and the real model. Second, to control two outputs of the underactuated systems with one input at the same time, a coordinative control scheme is introduced for weighting the control inputs of the two subsystems. Finally, in order to value the proposed control scheme, the Pendubot (pendulum robot) is selected as the experimental platform to verify the method. Experimental results show that the proposed control strategy can be easily applied and has higher control precision than the existing methods.  </div></p>

<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> 
In this paper, we study state-feedback control of Markov jump linear systems with state and mode-observation delays. We assume that the delay of the mode observation induced by the controllers follows an exponential distribution. We also introduce a time-varying state delay factor that is applied in the state-feedback controller. Our formulation provides a novel framework to analyze and design feedback control laws for the delayed Markov jump linear systems. We present a procedure to transform the closed-loop system into a standard Markov jump linear system with delays. Moreover, based on this transformation, we propose a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) to design feedback gains for stabilization and mixed H2/H∞ control. Numerical simulation is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> In this paper, we study a class of finite-time control problems for discretetime positive linear systems with time-varying state parameters. Although several interesting
control problems appearing in population biology, economics, and network epidemiology can be
described as the class of finite-time control problems, an efficient solution to the control problem
has not been yet found in the literature. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework
for solving the class of finite-time control problems via convex optimization. We illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method by a numerical simulation in the context of dynamical
product development processes.

<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> 
	Resource allocation is an important aspect of successful product development (PD). In this paper we formulate the resource allocation problem as a convex optimization problem. We formulate and solve two variants of this problem: the budget-constrained problem and the performance-constrained problem. Using convex optimization, we were able to solve to optimality large problem instances at a relatively small computational effort / cost. Both problems exhibit similar solution structure and results.

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the impact of a heretofore relatively unexplored input in the educational process&mdash;language environment at home&mdash;on student academic achievement during early childhood. Using the confidential data from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (1998-99), we are able to exploit cross-sectional geographic variation in local language environment, augmented with the recently developed instrumental variable strategy in Lewbel (2012), to identify the causal effect. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that in the third grade, speaking a language other than English at home has a statistically significant, negative effect on reading test scores, but the effect does not exist for math test scores. Second, the pattern persists through the fifth grade. However, the negative effect on reading test scores appears to be a result of the initial gap in the third grade because we do not find the language environment at home has any effects on the growth rates in the test scores, regardless of subjects. Third, the pattern in the effects of language environment remains unchanged whether the foreign language is Spanish or not. Finally, we find that the pattern differs across gender. The language environment appears to have a negative effect on both reading and math scores among girls, while it has an effect only on reading scores among boys.</div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines location as an outcome of college major choice. We document substantial differences in the spatial availability of college majors. These differences explain much of the cross-major variation in unemployment and migration, but not earnings. Using a natural experiment, we show that migration differences across majors appear to be driven by labor demand and not labor supply.</div></p>
